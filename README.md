# C++ Modules Repository

Welcome to the C++ Modules Repository! This repository contains a series of C++ modules designed to introduce and explore various concepts in C++. Each module builds upon the previous ones to enhance your understanding of C++ programming.

## Overview

The repository is organized into 9 modules, each focusing on different aspects of C++ programming:

### Module cpp00
- **Focus**: Basic variables and syntax exercises.
- **Description**: Introduces fundamental C++ concepts including variable types, operators, and basic syntax.

### Module cpp01
- **Focus**: Classes, strings, files, pointers, and references.
- **Description**: Teaches how to create and use classes, manipulate strings and files, and understand pointers and references.

### Module cpp02
- **Focus**: Fixed point class implementation.
- **Description**: Involves writing a `FixedPoint` class to reimplement a floating-point type, exploring numerical representations.

### Module cpp03
- **Focus**: Inheritance.
- **Description**: Covers the concept of inheritance in C++, including how to create derived classes and manage base class relationships.

### Module cpp04
- **Focus**: Advanced inheritance concepts.
- **Description**: Delves into advanced topics like polymorphism, method overloads, and pure virtual functions.

### Module cpp05
- **Focus**: Inheritance and exceptions.
- **Description**: Continues the exploration of inheritance and introduces exception handling mechanisms in C++.

### Module cpp06
- **Focus**: Type casting.
- **Description**: Teaches about typecasting in C++, including `reinterpret_cast`, `static_cast`, and `dynamic_cast`, along with their use cases and differences.

### Module cpp07
- **Focus**: Basic templates.
- **Description**: Introduces the concept of templates, showing how to create and use function and class templates.

### Module cpp08
- **Focus**: Advanced templates and STL.
- **Description**: Expands on template usage with more advanced scenarios and covers Standard Template Library (STL) containers and algorithms.

### Module cpp09
- **Focus**: Advanced STL usage.
- **Description**: Further explores STL containers and algorithms, pushing the understanding of the STL library to a more advanced level.

## How to Compile and Run

Each module comes with its own set of files and can be compiled separately. Hereâ€™s a general guide:

1. **Navigate to the module directory**:
   ```bash
   	cd cpp00
	```
2. **Compile the module**:
	```bash
		Make
	```
3. **Run the executable**:
	```bash
		./<module_executable>
	```
Replace `module_executable` with the actual names used in the module directory.
